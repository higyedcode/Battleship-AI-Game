# Battleship Game 🚢💥

Welcome to the Battleship Game showcase! 🎮 

This simple yet engaging Battleship game was created for my University Programming Fundamentals course, featuring a single-player mode where you can test your strategic prowess against an AI opponent. The AI player utilizes advanced statistics and probabilities to determine the next best optimal move, adjusting tactics dynamically during gameplay to maximize success.

## Features 🌟

- **AI Player with Statistics and Probabilities:**📈
  - The AI opponent leverages a sophisticated algorithm based on the principles outlined in the study [here](http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/december32011/).
  - It strategically analyzes the game board, optimizing its moves based on statistical probabilities, creating a challenging and dynamic gaming experience.

- **Intuitive GUI with Tkinter:** 🎆
  - The game boasts a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) created with Tkinter, ensuring a seamless and enjoyable gaming experience for players of all skill levels.
  - The interface is simple, effective, and easy to understand, providing a visually appealing representation of the game board and battleships.

- **Classic Gameplay:** 🕹️
  - The gameplay adheres to the classic Battleship rules. Each player has a game board with ships of different sizes, including a 5-block ship, a 4-block ship, two 3-block ships, and one 2-block ship.
  - Players take turns to guess the coordinates of the opponent's ships. If a hit is achieved, the player retains their turn until a miss occurs.
  - Hit and miss spots are visually marked on the board, enhancing the gaming experience.
